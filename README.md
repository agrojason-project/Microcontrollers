# Microcontroller Developers (MD) Team

## The duties of a MD
The MD team programs microcontrollers (ie Arduino) and makes sure that every sensor is well calibrated and returns right measurements. The team also suggests solutions on the mechanics of the greenhouse and is responsible for the implementation of the automations. 

## Temperature & Humidity control
Two DHT11 sensors measure temperature and humidity inside and outside the greenhouse.

#### Cooling system

#### Heating system
...

#### Increasing Humidity
...

#### Decreasing Humidity
...

## Substrate Moisture control
Soil humidity sensor manages the operation of the watering system.

#### Watering system
...

## Luminocity control
A photoresistor captures changes in luminocity level.

#### More light
...

#### Less light
...

## pH control
A liquid pH sensor indicates whether pH is out of regular value range, meaning that substrate should be replaced with a new one.
